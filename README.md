We investigate whether machine learning classification
algorithms suffer a decrease in performance when
classifying text summaries as opposed to the original
raw text. Using a data set of Reddit Posts
(with their abstractive summaries), we create extractive
summaries using BART, and apply popular M.L.
algorithms. The results show that, on average, the performance
of the algorithms was slightly worse when
classifying the extractive summaries compared to the
raw text. However, the decrease in performance was
not significant and did not affect the overall accuracy
of the algorithms. Abstractive summaries did not yield
equally satisfying results. This suggests that using
extractive summaries as input for classification algorithms
can be an effective way to reduce the amount
of data without sacrificing performance.
